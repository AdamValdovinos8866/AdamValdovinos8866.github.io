### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.

* Lab 5 part 1
    Lab 5, part 1 was personally one of my favorite labs to work with. This lab 
    mainly demonstrated how user input can affect parts of the program. when the
    user would input a value too big or small, that didnt follow the c++ integer limit, the program would notify the user that the program has stopped and it would exit the program. Personally, i enjoyed this lab because it demonstrates how conditional statements used user input and help shape the desired output.

* Lab 10 part 1
    Lab 10, part 2 was another favorite because i consider it to be very informational for first time users. i liked the idea of 2D vectors and comparison operators functioning together to create a educative program. Users can input different counties in california and know the population and the percentage of the states population residing in that county. This lab shows a general idea on how the programs of different textbooks and websites show data and facts based on a key word provided by the user.
