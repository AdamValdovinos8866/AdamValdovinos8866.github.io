### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.

* Lab 5 part 1
    Lab 5, part 1 was personally one of my favorite labs to work with. This lab 
    mainly demonstrated how user input can affect parts of the program. When the
    user would input a value too big or small, that didn't follow the c++ integer limit, the program would notify the user that it had stopped and it would exit the program. Personally, I enjoyed this lab because it demonstrates how conditional statements use user input to shape the desired output.

* Lab 10 part 1
    Lab 10, part 2 was another favorite because I consider it to be very informational for first time users. I liked the idea of 2D vectors and comparison operators functioning together to create a educative program. Users can input different counties in California and know the population and the percentage of the states population residing in that county. This lab shows a general idea on how the programs of different textbooks and websites online, show data and facts based on a key word provided by the user.
